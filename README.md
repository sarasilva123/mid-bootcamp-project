Description: Political Composition's Impact on the Tax and Social Security rates and on the GDP

This data analysis explores the impact of governmental composition - whether leaning towards the left, right, or center - on the tax burden of single taxpayers (without children), focusing on personal income tax and social security contributions. 

Additionally, it examines the effect of this governmental orientation on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the respective countries. 

Three key data sets used for this analysis:

I. OECD  - detailing personal income tax and social security rates
II. University of Zurich, Leuphana and Lucerne - datailing the government composition based on the Schmidt Index
III. GDP figures per year for 29 OECD countries 

The goal is to provide a comprehensive view of the interplay between government political composition and its economic implications on individuals and national economies.

The project is organized as follows:

- `gdp_final/`: This directory contains the raw data file related to GDP.
- `gov_final/`: This directory contains the raw data file related to Government composition.
- `tax_ss_final/`: This directory contains the raw data file related to the tax rates.
- `[mid-bootcamp-project]/`: Jupyter notebook used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- `tax_ss_gov_gdp_final_last/`: Final excel document for visualization purposes.
- `Tableau Presentation`: https://public.tableau.com/views/mid-bootcamp-projectSara/Project2?:language=pt-BR&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
- `README.md`: The hereby README file provides an overview of the project.
